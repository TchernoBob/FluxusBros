FluxusBros
===========


What is FluxusBros?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FluxusBros is a Visuals Mixing Script for Fluxus software. Fluxus is a 3D scheme
environement for realtime animation from mutiple inputs like midi, osc and sound.


Introdution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FluxusBros script mix different Fluxus visuals scripts with user triggers.
The visuals scripts contains abstracted controls, and the FluxusBros script
re-attribute the abstracted controls to actual controls depending of the actual
player controls mapping.
The FluxusBros system allow to map visuals to different areas.

How to Launch?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FluxusBros-Start will launch JackServer, then Fluxus with FluxusBros loaded.
If you want to launch FluxusBros from Fluxus, for devellopement for instance,
prefer FluxusBrosLauncher.scm to load. Options can be passed and all scripts
will be actualised at relaunch of FluxusBrosLauncher.scm to catch
modifications.

Folder Organisation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
visus    : all visuals scripts.
controls : control mappings.
utils    : tools files.

Visuals-Scripts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules to devellop new scripts inside:

All the visuals scripts must in /visu folder.
The script's file name must have the same name of the main function script.
The main function script must have two parameters : id and crossfader
The id parameter is a different identifier for each running script.
It contain the visu object of the running instance.
To get a string identifier for several reasons, you can use (send id Get-Name)
to obtain the string attached identifier.
It is made by :
    3nb-3nb-name_of_script
It match :
    CrossfaderNumber-CrossfaderBankLevel-NameOfScript
like "901-001-valley".
For example, this id is used in "c" function to find the appropriate control
(see Controls section)

Constructor:
A function can be created for the launch of the visual to initialise objects
and usefull variables. This function is automatically launched and must be name
like the visual script followed by "-build" and id parameter.

Destructor:
A function can be created for the end of the visual,
to destroy build objects or reinitialize variables. This function has to be
named as "name_of_the_script-destroy" and followed by the id parameter.
This function is also automatically called by the manager script.

Taking in example, the "test" visual.
The file have to be named "test.scm"
and the main function of the visual script have to be defined like this :
(define (test id cross)
To insert a cube primitive with (build-cube) and retain its value,
you must create:
(define test-primitives (make-hash))
(define (test-build id)
    (hash-set! test-primitives id (build-cube))
)
To destroy the (build-cube) used in the test visual, use the function
(define (test-destroy id)
and place a (destroy (hash-ref test-primitives id)) function inside.

Triggers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The triggers are the midi, osc or keyboard events which can
launch, kill, choose visuals and other few actions.
It is the managing system of the visuals.
The basic "Save-Trigger-File" can be use to place new triggers.
To make your own and complexer config :
 - create your folder
 - replace the name of the folder in the "load-config"
   file by your folder.
 - if you use multiple triggers file, make another load-config
   and load the different files.
 - make your trigger file in your folder.

To add a new trigger in the file, the syntax is like this :

NAME_OF_THE_TRIGGER
Hardware (just identify your different controlers)
type-of-control
address-to-catch-the-control
function-linked-to-the-trigger-when-activated
function-linked-to-the-trigger-when-desactivated
mapping-on-channel (experimental)

and add the next triggers to the below.
The different type of triggers are :
 midi note : note
 midi ccn : midi-ccn or ccn
 keyboard normal keys : kb
 keyboard special keys : kbs
 osc : osc

The address of controls:
midi address : (vector midi-channel number-of-the-control)
keyboard normal keys : character of the key
keyboard special keys : special number of the key
(cf (help keys-special-down) or (help keys-special-pressed) in Fluxus)

Controls
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The control part is to act on the inside of a visual.
In the visual, the function to use is "c", like control.
The basic way to use this is :
(c "name-of-the-control-in-a-string" id)
and the manager script will search in the config files to
which midi,osc or keyboard control it is linked to.
To configure these links, the files are in the "controls" folder.
The basic Save-Control-File can be use to place your control config.
To make complex config, the system use on config file for one visual
with the same name. To use the multiple hardware separation system,
you can specify the hardware at the end of the file name.
For example, for the test.scm visual used with
your FAVORITE-MIDI-CONTROLLER, create thefile
"test.FAVORITE-MIDI-CONTROLLER" in the "controls" folder.
To add a new control in your file, here is the syntax :

name-of-the-visual (even in a same named file)
name-of-the-control (the name used in the visual script with the "c" function)
Hardware
type-of-control
address-of-the-control
mapping-on-channel (experimental, stay on 0)
default-mode
first-default-value
second-default-value
third-default-value
fourth-default-value

The different type of control are :
 midi note : note
 midi ccn : ccn
 keyboard normal keys : kb
 keyboard special keys : kbs
 osc : osc
 fake : a non controlable control which just can handle default values

The default-mode value act on the value to catch on the visual loading:
 -1 : connect to the hardware control
 0  : automatic setting
 1  : use the first default value
 2  : use the second default value
 3  : use the third default value
 4  : use the fourth default value
